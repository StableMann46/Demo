<h2>Topic 01: Conventions: </h2>
Repository meaning folder.
Commit chnages means pushing updated code/text.
` Tilda means we are currently in our root directory.

<h2> Topic 02: Configuring Git </h2>
We do it using the command "git config" 
There are two types of configuration: One is global level -- changing the full system using one email address. Another is the Local level -- let's say we have a project and specific repository -- changing that using another   email address.

This is to set username<br>
git config --global user.name "My name"

To set email address<br>
git config --global user.email "abcd@gmail.com"

To see the chnages we just did <br>
git config -- global --list

<h2> Topic 03: Clone and Status </h2>
Clone is used for cloning a repo on our local machine <br>
Command: git clone <- some link ->

Status: displays the state of the code. <br>
command: git status

Topic 01: Conventions: <br>
Repository meaning folder.
Commit chnages means pushing updated code/text.
` Tilda means we are currently in our root directory.

Topic 02: Configuring Git <br>
We do it using the command "git config" 
There are two types of configuration: One is global level -- changing the full system using one email address. Another is the Local level -- let's say we have a project and specific repository -- changing that using another   email address.

This is to set username
git config --global user.name "My name"

To set email address
git config --global user.email "abcd@gmail.com"

To see the chnages we just did.
git config -- global --list

Topic 03: Clone and Status <br>
